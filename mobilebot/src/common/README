=== Files ===

NOTE: There are lots of files in here. Only the few that you will need to use are highlighted. You
      won't need to modify or implement any code in this directory.

= angle_functions.hpp
    - definition of functions that help perform math on angles. Functions for wrapping quantities to
      common angle ranges and for adding/subtracting angles are provided.

= grid_utils.hpp
    - definition of functions for converting between grid and global coordinates. You'll find these
      very useful for all parts of this assignment.
      
= interpolation.hpp
    - functions for performing linear interpolation of poses.
    
= point.hpp
    - definition of Point class template
    - definition of useful functions for Points, like distance between points, angle to points, etc.
    - you should find this class very useful throughout the assignment
    
= pose_trace.hpp
    - declaration of PoseTrace, which maintains a time sequence of poses and automatically performs
      appropriate linear interpolation of poses at desired times
    
= timestamp.h
    - contains utime_now() function which returns the current system time in microseconds. You
      should use this function whenever a time value is needed.
